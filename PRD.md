Product Requirements Document: Finsense
Version: 1.1
Date: July 7, 2025

1. Introduction & Vision
Finsense is an intelligent, web-first expense and bill tracking application that transforms how users manage their personal finances. By leveraging AI-powered optical character recognition (OCR) and a natural language interface, Finsense eliminates the tedious manual entry of expenses. Users simply upload a photo of a receipt, and the app automatically digitizes, categorizes, and stores the information. The core vision is to provide users with an effortless way to track their spending and gain actionable insights through an intuitive dashboard and a conversational AI chat, making financial awareness accessible to everyone.

2. Problem Statement
Managing personal finances is often a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process. People struggle to keep track of their daily cash and card expenditures, forget to log receipts, and lack a clear, up-to-date understanding of their spending habits. This leads to budget overruns, missed financial goals, and general anxiety about money. Existing solutions may require manual entry, lack intelligent categorization, or fail to provide intuitive, actionable insights.

3. Target Audience
Financially-Conscious Individuals (25-45): Professionals and young families who want to actively manage their budgets, track spending against goals, and optimize their financial health.

Freelancers & Small Business Owners: Individuals who need to meticulously track expenses for tax purposes and client billing, and who value efficiency and accuracy.

Students & Young Adults: Users who are new to managing their own finances and need a simple, engaging tool to build good financial habits.

4. Core Features & User Stories
4.1. Feature: AI-Powered Receipt Scanning
Description: The core data-entry mechanism. The user can upload or drag-and-drop a picture of a bill or receipt, and the AI will process it automatically.

User Stories:

As a user, I want to upload an existing image or PDF of a bill from my computer, so that I can add expenses I receive digitally (e.g., via email).

As a user, I want the app to automatically extract the vendor name, date, total amount, line items, and currency, so that I don't have to type this information manually.

As a user, I want the app to intelligently suggest a spending category (e.g., "Groceries," "Dining," "Transport"), so that my expenses are organized without extra effort.

As a user, I want to review the extracted data and be able to correct any errors before saving, so that I can ensure my records are 100% accurate.

4.2. Feature: Conversational AI Chat ("Finsense AI")
Description: A chat interface allowing users to query their financial data using natural language. This AI will use function/tool calls to interact with the user's private database for accuracy and security.

User Stories:

As a user, I want to ask questions like "How much did I spend on coffee last month?" so that I can get quick answers without manually filtering data.

As a user, I want to make queries such as "Show me all transactions from Amazon over $50," so that I can easily find specific expenses.

As a user, I want to ask about my budget, like "How much of my 'Dining Out' budget is left for this month?" so that I can make informed spending decisions.

As a user, I want to be confident that the AI is only accessing my data and that my queries are private.

4.3. Feature: Interactive Spending Dashboard
Description: A visual summary of the user's financial activity, providing at-a-glance insights.

User Stories:

As a user, I want to see a dashboard with my total spending for the current day, week, and month, so that I have a clear overview of my recent activity.

As a user, I want to view a chart (e.g., pie or bar chart) that breaks down my spending by category, so that I can understand where my money is going.

As a user, I want to see a trend line of my spending over time, so that I can identify patterns or lifestyle inflation.

As a user, I want to be able to filter my dashboard view by different time periods (e.g., Last 30 Days, This Year, Custom Range), so that I can analyze my finances flexibly.

4.4. Feature: Budgeting and Goals
Description: Proactive tools to help users manage their spending against predefined limits.

User Stories:

As a user, I want to set monthly spending budgets for different categories (e.g., $500 for Groceries), so that I can control my spending.

As a user, I want to receive a notification when I am approaching or have exceeded my budget for a category, so that I can adjust my behavior in real-time.

4.5. Feature: User Profile & Settings
Description: Centralized control for user-specific configurations.

User Stories:

As a user, I want to set a default global currency (e.g., USD, EUR, JPY), so that all my expenses are displayed and calculated in my home currency.

As a user, I want to manage my account details and password, so that my account is secure.

As a user, I want to be able to create, edit, or delete my custom spending categories, so that the app fits my personal spending habits.

5. Functional & Non-Functional Requirements
5.1. Functional Requirements
Data Extraction: The AI model must extract the following fields from receipts:

Vendor/Store Name

Transaction Date & Time

Total Amount

Tax Amount (if available)

Currency Symbol/Code

Line Items (Item name, quantity, price) - Stretch Goal for V1

AI Chat & Tooling:

The conversational AI must translate natural language into structured queries.

It will use predefined functions/tools to interact with the database, such as:

get_transactions(date_range, category, amount_filter)

get_spending_summary(period, group_by_category)

get_budget_status(category)

The AI must not have direct database access; it can only call these secure, validated functions.

Data Storage: Each user's data must be isolated using row-level security (RLS) policies in PostgreSQL to ensure absolute data privacy. The logged-in user's session must only grant access to their own data through secure database queries with user-specific WHERE clauses.

5.2. Non-Functional Requirements
Security:

All user data must be encrypted both at rest (in the database) and in transit (via TLS/SSL).

Authentication must be robust (e.g., OAuth, secure password hashing).

User financial data will never be used to train global AI models without explicit, opt-in consent.

Performance:

Receipt processing (from upload to data review) should take less than 8 seconds.

Dashboard and chat responses should load in under 2 seconds.

Scalability: The architecture must be able to support a growing number of users without degradation in performance.

Usability: The UI/UX must be clean, intuitive, and require minimal onboarding for a new user to understand the core functionality.

Platform: The primary platform will be a responsive web application, accessible on all modern desktop and mobile browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

6. Out of Scope (Future Considerations for V2)
The following features will not be included in the initial release but are potential enhancements for future versions:

Native Mobile Application (iOS/Android): A dedicated, installable mobile app.

Bank Account Integration: Automatically syncing transactions from bank accounts and credit cards.

Shared Wallets / Bill Splitting: Managing finances with a partner or splitting bills with friends.

Recurring Bill Prediction: Identifying and automatically scheduling recurring payments (subscriptions, rent).

Advanced Reporting & Export: Exporting data to CSV/PDF for tax purposes.

7. Success Metrics
The success of Finsense will be measured by:

User Engagement:

Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU)

Average number of receipts scanned per user per week.

User Retention:

Day 1, Week 1, and Month 1 retention rates.

Feature Adoption:

Percentage of active users utilizing the AI Chat and Budgeting features.

Performance & Quality:

High user satisfaction scores from surveys.

Minimal bug report rate.

8. Proposed Technology Stack
Frontend Framework: React (with TypeScript) for building a scalable, component-based, and maintainable user interface.

UI & Styling: Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to building a responsive and custom design rapidly. Components from shadcn/ui can be used for pre-built, accessible UI elements.

Backend Runtime: Node.js with a framework like Express.js to handle API requests, business logic, and communication with other services.

Database: PostgreSQL as the primary relational database, containerized with Docker for local development. Production deployment will use managed PostgreSQL services. This provides strong ACID compliance, mature ecosystem, and excellent performance for financial data.

Authentication: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing for secure user sessions. OAuth integration (GitHub) will be implemented for social login options.

AI & Machine Learning:

OCR Service: Tesseract.js for accurate text extraction from receipt images.

Conversational AI: DeepSeek API for its powerful natural language understanding and function-calling capabilities to interact with user data.

Hosting & Deployment: 
- Local Development: Docker Compose orchestrating PostgreSQL, Redis (for caching), and the Node.js backend
- Production: Cloud hosting (AWS/GCP/Azure) with containerized services
- Frontend: Static hosting (Vercel, Netlify) or CDN distribution
